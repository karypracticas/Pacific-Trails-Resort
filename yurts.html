            <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
                <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off
                    the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls,
                    a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd><br>
        
                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down
                    quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
                    experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and
                    cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
                    located in the lodge.</dd><br>
        
                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to
                    dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
                    It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
                    adventure!</dd><br>
